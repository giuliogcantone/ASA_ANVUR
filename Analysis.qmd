## Operantions Sampling Frame

Joining the journal concepts to the sampling frame

```{r}
sampling_frame <- db_papers_ita_f %>%
  filter(department %in% IN$department[1:64],
         D_13 == 1) %>%
  left_join(db_j %>% select(journal = display_name,
                            j_concepts = x_concepts)) %>%
  select(title, journal,author_contribution,year,concepts,j_concepts,department) %>%
  arrange(journal)
```

prova

```{r}
sampling_frame %>%
  filter(department == "Economics and Business, Catania") %>%
  unnest(c(concepts),
         names_sep = "_") %>%
  filter(concepts_level == 1) %>%
  transmute(title,journal,author_contribution,year,
            concept = concepts_display_name,
            p = concepts_score,
            j_concepts,department) %>%
  unnest(c(j_concepts)) %>%
  filter(level == 1) %>%
  transmute(title,journal,author_contribution,year,
            concept,p,
            j_concept = display_name,
            j_p = score,
            department) %>%
  filter(p > 0,
         j_p > 0)
```
